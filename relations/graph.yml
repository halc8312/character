# Character Relationship Graph
# This file provides an optional centralized view of character relationships.
# The authoritative source for relationships is each character's relationships array.
# This graph can be used for visualization or cross-referencing.
#
# Structure:
#   a: source character ID
#   b: target character ID
#   type: relationship type (from vocab.yml relationship_types)
#   intensity: -5 (hostile) to 5 (very close)
#   summary: brief description
#   tags: optional tags for filtering
#
# Example:
#   - a: alice
#     b: bob
#     type: friend
#     intensity: 4
#     summary: "Childhood friends who trust each other deeply"
#     tags: ["core_cast", "established"]

edges: []

# TODO: Consider implementing validation for graph.yml in validate_characters.py
# to check that all character IDs (a, b) exist in characters/ directory
# and that relationship types are valid according to vocab.yml.
